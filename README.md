## Development

This is another project we did at Scrimba, really fun concepts, I had the chance to revisit a ton of React features I forgot over time.

## Stack
- React 
- Vite


### Scrimba
If you want to learn stuff like this give a go on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), their courses are awesome and a lot of practices, almost every lesson has a challenge and they provide a bunch of solo projects.
